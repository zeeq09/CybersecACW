Kevin Mitnick is one of the most famous black-hat hackers turned ethical hackers in history and is considered by many to be the no 1 hacker in the world. Mitnick's early years were marked by his extraordinary talent for hacking and manipulation of computer systems. He was fascinated by computers and how they worked, and he quickly learned how to exploit their vulnerabilities. In the early 1990s, Mitnick began hacking into major corporations, including Motorola, Nokia, and IBM.
These hacks caught the attention of international law enforcement, landing him a place on the FBI's most-wanted list. But Mitnick's hacking spree eventually caught up with him, and he was arrested in 1995 and sentenced to five years in prison. After his release from prison, Kevin Mitnick became a world-famous ethical hacker, using his skills to help organisations identify and fix security vulnerabilities. He also wrote several books about hacking and security, and he became a frequent speaker at security conferences. Today, Mitnick is a consultant and public speaker and runs Mitnick Security Consulting LLC to advise companies on cybersecurity. He will go down in history as one of the best hackers of all time.
